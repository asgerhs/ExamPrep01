## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

- Clone Project

- Remove `.git` folder and init project with `git init`

- Create a new repository and commit / push the code to this repository

- Go to *travis-ci.com* and Active the new repository

- Create two new local databases (replace xxx with a name that makes sense for the project)

- `xxx`

- `xxx_test`

- Create a remote database on the deployment server, with the same name as the first one above (`xxx`)

- Open the file `.travis.yml` and change the script `CREATE DATABASE startcode_test;` to use the same name as the local test-database (`xxx_test`)

### Setup CI-control (Let Maven deploy when BUILD and TESTS are GREEN &#x1F49A;)

- Go to travis-ci.com, and select the new repository in the dashboard

- Click `More options` and select `settings`

- Create four new `Environment Variables`:

	- `REMOTE_PW` : Password for *script_user*
	- `REMOTE_USER` : *script_user*
	- `SURGE_LOGIN` : *surge email address*
	- `SURGE_TOKEN` : *surge token*
		- To get token: Run `surge token` in Frontend project folder


- Locate the file `.travis.yml` in the root of the project

- Find the section `script`
	- Change the domain to an name that makes sense and save the file.

- **Test the CI pipeline:**

- Make a small change index.html, so we can see the change after deployment

- Run `mvn clean test` in the project as we wont commit to master without testing.

- If no errors, commit and push the changes to master branch

- Verify that the build started under the `Branches` section at travis-ci.com

- Verify after a few minutes that travis have deployed the war file on your deployment server.

  
## Backend

### Initial Setup
- Locate the `config.properties` in the `resources` folder of the Backend project

	- Change the `db.database` to the name you gave the database above (`xxx`)
	
- In a terminal in the root of the Backend project run `mvn test` and fix the errors, if any

### Setup the deployment server (Only first time)

- Locate the file `pom.xml` the the root of the Backend folder. Change the value of `remote.server` to the url for your own deployment server.

- ssh into your deployment and run the command `sudo nano /opt/tomcat/bin/setenv.sh`

- Add these lines to the files, but replace with your own values

- `export DEPLOYED="DEV_ON_DIGITAL_OCEAN"`

- `export USER="<YOUR_DB_USER>"`

- `export PW="<YOUR_DB_PASSWORD>"`

- `export CONNECTION_STR="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/"`

- Save the file and run this command to restart tomcat `sudo systemctl restart tomcat`

## Getting Started - Frontend
### Initial setup
- Locate the Frontend folder
	- Run `npm install` in the root of the frontend folder
	- Run `npm start` to start the project

### Use the Frontend
- The file `settings.js` contains all the links of the website
	- to get an URL use:
		- `import URLSettings from './settings'`
		- `URLSettings.getURL("xxx")` (xxx is the name of the link ex. Home or Login)
- Locate the file `login/ApiFacade` and change the `URL` to the Deployed Backend URL
